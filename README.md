Control servo motor via web browser with lua
Using static IP address of ESP-12. In order to start using, just copy the code to the esp model and after terminal delivers you ip, just type that IP address in the browser. The unusual thing you will see is the PORT number I have added in the code, it is because that port I have opened on my router and now I can see my IP address outside of my network :) Ask me anything freely.
